# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This Rock, Paper, Scissors Game, is a personal project created using Python to develop a simple game against the computer. The game utilizes basic functions, loops, and statements to iterate multiple games, and time delays are incorporated to simulate a realistic thinking process.

This project could have been completed and launched in a single file, however, I wanted to try making a multi-file program to practice calling functions.
The Rock_Paper_Scissors.py file creates the core of the game and accepts user input before simulating an opponents move. 
The play_a_game_question.py file is used to present a "main menu" and ask if the user would like to play or quit. 
And the play_a_game.py file allows for the program to execute using just one line.
